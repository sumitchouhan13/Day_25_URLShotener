          A URL shortener is a simple tool that takes a long URL and turns it
          into whatever URL you would like it to be.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          I want to clarify that a URL shortener is the same as a link
          shortener… is the same as a link shrinker… a link compressor… a URL
          condenser… a vanity URL creator… I think that’s them all covered. They
          are all different ways of saying the same thing, which is that we want
          to take something long and ugly, then make it short and cute. To keep
          it simple, I will stick with the term URL shortener from today until
          the day I die.
